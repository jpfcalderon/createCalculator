Objective:
this program will allow user to calculate simple equations to get an answer
We will:
- create code that adds
- create code that subtracts
- create code that multiplies
- create code that divides
- create code that user can select intger from 0-9
- create code that allows user to select second intger from 0-9
- code that gives user the output from the 2 numbers they selected depending on whether they chose to
    - add  - subtract  - multiply  - divide
- loop the calculator so user can use as many times as they want
Pseudocode:
#make function that adds two numbers
#make function that subtracts two numbers
#make function that multiplies two numbers
#make function that dividess two numbers
    #print select operation
    #print add
    #print subtract
    #print multiply
    #print divide
#take input from the user
#check if choice is one of the four options
    #if (choice 1)
        #print
    #elif (choice 2)
        #print
    #elif(choice 3)
        #print
    #elif(choice 4)
        #print
       
#break
#else (if user inputs anything else)
    #print("invalid input")
